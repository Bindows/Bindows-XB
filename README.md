# BindowsXB
Developement builds of Bindows XB,a Windows XP "variation" designed to be faster,easier to use,and more secure

# What is Bindows?

Bindows is a variation of Windows designed to be faster in any way.
We'll only make Bindows versions from Windows versions considered "abandonware",so the copyright hammer won't strike us.
We are planning to do the Bindows treatment on Windows 98,ME,and a bunch of other obscure OSes.
